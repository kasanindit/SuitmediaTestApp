# Suitmedia Test App

This project showcases an Android application structured with multiple activities. It features user selection from a list and passes the selected data back to update the UI accordingly. Built with Kotlin, ViewModel, and Retrofit for robust data handling.
It has a feature to check whether a given input is a palindrome. The implementation ignores spaces and is case-insensitive, allowing flexible input formats. This is achieved by preprocessing the input string—removing whitespace and converting all characters to lowercase—before comparison.
